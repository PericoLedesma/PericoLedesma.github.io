			To conclude, we extended the 100 prisoners and 1 light bulb riddle into a version that included more than one light bulb, and showed several old and new solving strategies. We found that the old strategies that already worked on the one light bulb riddle could also be extended to the riddle that included more light bulbs. Furthermore, we made three new solving techniques which all have pros and cons. The binary representation and when the number of light bulbs is one less than the number or prisoners or more are good strategies given that all the assumptions both need do hold. In which the binary representation is a more effective strategy as you need fewer light bulbs to signal the same thing as in protocol 4. The new solving strategy that included creating several groups that have several counters looked like a simple, and easy extension of the one counter method. However, while it looks feasible on paper the protocol does not hold in certain sequences of prisoners going into the interrogation room. Therefore, this is not a protocol you should use to solve this riddle.
