A group of 100 prisoners, all together in the prison dining area, are told that they will be all put in isolation cells and then will be interrogated one by one in a room containing a light with an on/off switch. The prisoners may communicate with one another by toggling the light switch (and that is the only way in which they can communicate). The light is initially switched off. There is no fixed order of interrogation, or interval between interrogations, and the same prisoner may be interrogated again at any stage. When interrogated, a prisoner can either do nothing or toggle the light switch, or announce that all the prisoners have been interrogated. If that announcement is true, the prisoners will (all) be set free, but if it is false, they will be in jail forever. While still in the dining room, and

before the prisoners go to their isolation cells (forever), can the prisoners agree on a protocol that will set them free? [1].
We will change the number of light bulbs into a n amount for our variation. Therefore, there will be a n amount of light bulbs available to switch on or off in our interrogation room. We will first explain the steps that [1] have taken to solve the problem for one light bulb after which we will increase the explanation for more light bulbs. We will need to build a Kripke model and examine the many states and actions to solve this problem. Another important assumption we adopt from [1] is that this question is not a trick question. Therefore, we only have logical solutions.

       <h3>Literature review</h3>
In [1] they provide several protocols, and solutions to the one hundred prisoners and one light bulb riddle. During the book they use natural deduction to break down the problem, and first start with a prove for a small number of prisoners before adding more and more prisoners. Therefore, if the problem can be solved for n people, it can also be solved for n + 1. In this review of the newly created riddle we will also use this strategy of natural deduction. During the method section we will use the [1] to give the explanation for the riddle with one light bulb, on which we will describe how the problem works with more light bulbs, and how this changes the protocols that come with it.
